Designing a database schema for Tinder Application
Here my corner usecase is creating a user profile, matching with people basis on the swiping activity and there by starting a conversation.

USER_PROFILE
 userid(primary key)
 username UNIQUE

 genderid(foreign key to gender table)

GENDER

INTERESTED_IN_GENDER
 id(primary key)
 userid (foreign key to userprofile table) UNIQUE

USER_MATCHING

 useridGiven (foreign key to userprofile table)
 useridReceived (foreign key to userprofile table)

In this schema, the USER_PROFILE table stores information about each user, such as their name, bio details, gender, age, location, occupation, and genderid as foreign key.
                the GENDER table stores its id and says the gender type of each user like male or female.
		    the INTERESTED_IN_GENDER stores the genderid of each user and facilitates the interest of user.
		    the RELATION_TYPE stores its id and name of some sample relations like casual date, new friends.
		    the INTERESTED_IN_RELATION stores userid and relid.The user will select the relationship type they are interested in. For each type they choose, weâ€™ll store one record in the INTERESTED_IN_RELATION table.
		    the USER_MATCHING stores id and also information about each match between two users.A useridGiven, a useridReceived, userSwipe tells yes or no in which yes mean liked and no mean disliked.
		    the CONVERSATION stores userid, startedtime, endedtime and message content of users.
